--------------------

The studio is the main interface you'll use to build and edit your chatbot. From here, among other things, you can:

- Train an NLU model
- Create conversation flow
- Manage content
- Test and debug your chatbot

You will notice on the left menu there are a couple of sections available. Some of these are built inside Botpress (like _Content_ and _Flows_), while others are there because of modules installed. 

Indeed, Botpress is a highly modular platform, and the modules themselves provide the majority of the features you will use. You may use experimental ones or even develop your modules.
