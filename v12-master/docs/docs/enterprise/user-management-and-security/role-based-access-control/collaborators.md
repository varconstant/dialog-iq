**RBAC** (Role-Based Access Control) allows you to control what your collaborators can access.

After adding a role, Botpress automatically generates a once-off password for the newly created user account.

:::tip
You can also change a collaborator's role by clicking the **Action** button next to the user whose role you wish to change. In addition to the changing roles, the menu allows you to change the password, remove a user from the workspace (Botpress retains the email and password, enabling you to add the user back), or delete the user.
